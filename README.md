# MockSMS
Android application to create/craft fake sms.

# How it works?
: MockSMS works locally, it just acts like an SMS application and creates SMS with the data provided by you. Using it for dirty purposes isn't the responsibility of the developer.

# Features :
### Sms Types:
• Inbox  
• Outbox  
• Sent  
• Draft  
• Queued  
• Failed
### Sms States:
• Read   
• Seen  
• Delivered

### Extra :
• Works without SuperUser Access.  
• Works with almost all devices (except some HTC, Samsung and other).  
• `Random Service Center` for making message look more real.  
• 2 minutes Difference between message creation time and receiving time (fake) for making message look more real
